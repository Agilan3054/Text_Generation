# Poetry Generation using GRU

This project demonstrates the generation of poetry using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) implemented with Keras and TensorFlow. The RNN model is trained on a dataset of poems to learn the patterns and structures of poetry, and then it generates new poems based on the learned patterns.


## Objective

The generation of poetry using machine learning techniques has gained interest in recent years. This project explores the use of Recurrent Neural Networks, a type of artificial neural network designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data, for generating poetry.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
